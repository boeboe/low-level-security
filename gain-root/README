Data only attack
================

This example shows how to do a buffer overflow, hereby manipulating other variables and changing the execution flow of the program.

On modern compilers, you need to disable several counter measures in order to demonstrate this phenomena.

1. Disable ASLR (adress space layout randomization):

	sudo echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

2. Disable canaries:

	gcc -fno-stack-protector 

3. Disable non-executable stack markings:

	gcc -z execstack 

    execstack --set-execstack <executable>



SOLUTION:

	buf: ffffdcf0 cookie: ffffdcfc
	FFFFFFFFFFFFDCBA
	you win!
